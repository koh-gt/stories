# The Fall of the Japanese Yen, Economic Contagion and Conflict in the 2030s, and the Rise of the New World Order

### Contagion

#### Timeline: 2019-2022

The years 2019-2022 were characterized by unprecedented economic stimulus measures across the globe. Governments and central banks, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, unleashed massive fiscal and monetary stimuli to support their economies. Interest rates were slashed to near-zero levels, and quantitative easing became the norm. In Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) continued its long-standing policy of maintaining low interest rates to combat deflation and stimulate economic activity. However, these measures led to an accumulation of substantial public debt.

#### 2023: Diverging Monetary Policies

By 2023, a clear divergence in monetary policies emerged between Japan and the United States. The BoJ maintained its ultra-low interest rates due to Japan’s high debt levels, necessitating continued economic support to prevent a debt crisis. This policy involved massive buybacks of government bonds to keep yields low. Conversely, the United States, facing rising inflationary pressures, embarked on an aggressive tightening cycle. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates to over 5%, aiming to cool down the overheated economy and curb inflation.
The weakening yen had profound implications for the global economy in the mid to late 2020s. Japan, heavily reliant on imports, faced skyrocketing costs for essential goods and energy. Inflation surged, eroding consumer purchasing power and deepening economic woes. The Japanese government's ability to service its debt was severely compromised, leading to a crisis of confidence in Japanese bonds. Global investors, fearing a broader economic contagion, began pulling out of other Asian markets, causing a ripple effect across the region.
Emerging markets, particularly those with high levels of dollar-denominated debt, were hit hard as the strengthening USD made debt servicing more expensive. Capital flight from these economies led to currency depreciations, stock market declines, and banking crises. The economic instability in Asia triggered a slowdown in global trade, affecting growth in Europe and other regions.

### The Time Period Between 2024 and the 2030s: Japan’s Economic Struggles and the Hyperinflation of the Yen

#### 2024: The Initial Yen Collapse and the Carry Trade

As 2024 unfolded, Japan's economy was caught in a perilous position. The yen's substantial weakening against the US dollar due to divergent monetary policies sparked significant economic challenges. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) had kept interest rates extremely low to manage the country’s high debt levels, while the US Federal Reserve had raised rates to over 5%. This created a lucrative carry trade opportunity, where investors borrowed in yen at low rates to invest in higher-yielding US assets, further driving down the yen's value.
The contrasting monetary policies led to significant market distortions. The US stock market continued to soar, buoyed by strong economic fundamentals and investor confidence. Meanwhile, the Japanese yen (JPY) weakened dramatically against the US dollar (USD). This depreciation was driven by the widening interest rate differential and the perception of Japan's economic fragility. Investors engaged in massive carry trades, borrowing cheaply in yen to invest in higher-yielding US assets, further exacerbating the yen’s decline.


#### 2025-2027: Selling US Bonds and the Immediate Consequences
> Faced with a rapidly depreciating currency and rising import costs, the Japanese government and the BoJ took drastic measures. In an attempt to stabilize the yen and control inflation, Japan began selling its substantial holdings of US Treasury bonds. This move aimed to provide liquidity in the domestic market and support the yen. However, this action had several immediate and long-term consequences:

Selling US bonds depleted Japan’s foreign exchange reserves, weakening its ability to defend the yen in the currency markets.
The selling pressure on US Treasuries led to rising yields, increasing borrowing costs globally, and adding strain to already vulnerable emerging markets.
The selling of US bonds signaled distress to global investors, leading to a loss of confidence in Japan's economic stability and further speculative attacks on the yen.

#### 2028-2029: Interest Rate Hikes and Their Fallout

In response to these challenges, the BoJ was compelled to raise interest rates to curb inflation and restore confidence in the yen. 
These rate hikes, however, had severe repercussions such as higher interest rates increased the cost of servicing Japan’s already massive public debt, leading to fears of a sovereign debt crisis.
The combination of higher rates and reduced liquidity caused a sharp economic contraction. Businesses faced higher borrowing costs, leading to reduced investment and increased bankruptcies. Consumer spending plummeted as loan repayment burdens grew.
These responses led to significant stress in the banking sector. Many banks, holding large amounts of government debt, saw their balance sheets deteriorate as the value of their bond holdings fell.

#### 2030s: Hyperinflation and Economic Collapse

By the early 2030s, Japan's economy was in dire straits. 
The combination of reduced foreign exchange reserves, high debt servicing costs, and economic contraction led to a severe loss of confidence in the yen. 
The BoJ's efforts to stabilize the currency and control inflation proved futile. The situation soon spiraled into hyperinflation.
The repeated policy shifts and economic turmoil eroded confidence in the BoJ and the Japanese government’s ability to manage the economy.
Despite attempts to prop up the yen, it continued to depreciate rapidly. Import prices skyrocketed, leading to runaway inflation. As inflation soared, businesses and consumers alike adjusted their expectations, leading to a wage-price spiral where rising wages and prices fed into each other.

#### Hyperinflation and Its Impact

Hyperinflation devastated Japan’s economy. The value of savings was obliterated, and purchasing power plummeted. Ordinary Japanese citizens faced severe hardship, with basic goods becoming unaffordable. The economic collapse led to widespread social unrest and political instability.
Internationally, Japan’s hyperinflation had far-reaching effects. The collapse of one of the world’s largest economies contributed to global financial instability. Trade partners faced reduced demand for exports, while investors sought safer assets, leading to increased volatility in global markets.

### Escalation of Local Conflicts in the 2030s: US-Japan-Taiwan and BRICS

> The economic turmoil of the 2020s and early 2030s, including Japan's hyperinflation and the broader global financial instability, created fertile ground for geopolitical tensions. These tensions manifested in local conflicts, particularly between the US, Japan, and Taiwan on one side, and BRICS (China, Russia, India) on the other. Understanding the escalation of these conflicts requires examining the underlying economic, political, and military dynamics.

#### Economic Instability and Strategic Rivalries

The economic instability of the 2030s, particularly Japan's hyperinflation and weakened economy, had significant geopolitical ramifications.
The economic struggles intensified competition for resources, further escalating tensions due to a better performing neighouring China. China held a strategic chokehold on raw materials essential for technological hardware such as energy for AI, rare earth elements for EVs.
These commodities became critical points of contention.
The increasingly bipolar world order, dominated by the US and China, led to realignments in global power structures. Weakened economies like Japan sought closer alliances with the US for security and economic support, while China strengthened ties with SEA, Russia and India through BRICS.

#### The US-Japan-Taiwan Alliance

The strategic alliance between the US, Japan, and Taiwan was driven by mutual interests in countering China's growing influence. Key developments included:
The US bolstered its military presence with its allies in the Asia-Pacific, as well as reinforcing alliances with Japan and Taiwan. This included joint military exercises, increased deployments, and advanced weapons systems.
The US provided economic aid to Japan to stabilize its economy and counteract hyperinflation. This support extended to nearby Taiwan, integrating it more deeply into US-led economic frameworks. Strengthened defense agreements and security pacts between the US, Japan, and Taiwan aimed to deter Chinese aggression and ensure regional stability.

#### The BRICS Bloc: China, Russia, and India

In response to the US-Japan-Taiwan alliance, BRICS nations, particularly China, Russia, and India, sought to assert their influence and protect their interests such as strategic partnerships, regional influence and economic cooperation.
China, Russia, and India deepened their strategic partnerships through economic, military, and political cooperation. This included joint military exercises, arms sales, and coordinated diplomatic efforts, similar to US and its allies.
China expanded its influence in the South China Sea and East China Sea, asserting territorial claims and increasing its military presence. 
Russia and India supported China’s initiatives, viewing them as counterweights to US dominance. The Kra Canal's completion allowed for the diversion of oil tankers away from US-allied Singapore through Thailand, reducing the potential impact of maritime sanctions..
BRICS nations increased economic cooperation, promoting trade agreements and infrastructure projects that bypassed the use of the US Dollar and Western financial systems such as SWIFT. This weakens the economic sanctioning ability of the US on BRICS member states. 
Initiatives like the Belt and Road and the International North-South Transport Corridor subvert reliance on the US Dollar by relying on a gold-pegged BRICS central bank cryptocurrency.

#### Escalation of Conflicts

Several key incidents and developments led to the escalation of local conflicts in the 2030s.
During the Taiwan Straits crisis beginning in the mid 2020s, China’s increasing military maneuvers near Taiwan led to heightened tensions. Taiwan, with US and Japanese support, fortified its defenses, leading to a series of confrontations and near-misses between military forces.
Fujian and various nuclear powered Type-004 aircraft carriers by China posed significant security risk to US carrier groups in the South China Sea, resulting in a greater frequency of skirmishes between Chinese and US alliance forces.
Disputes over contested islands in the East China Sea and South China Sea escalated. The rapid construction of landing strips on captured islands by the PLA led to even greater military tensions in the SEA region.
Both blocs engaged in cyber and information warfare, targeting each other’s critical infrastructure and spreading disinformation. These actions heightened mistrust and exacerbated tensions.

#### Why Escalation Occurred
The strategic rivalry between the US and China, amplified by their respective alliances, created a climate of mutual distrust. 
Each side viewed the other’s actions as aggressive and expansionist, leading to a security dilemma. There was soon an arms war, where each side raced to bolster their military capabilities more than the other side.
Economic instability, resource competition, and the need for political legitimacy drove nations to assert their power aggressively.
This included leveraging military strength to secure strategic interests such as fresh water, where climate change related droughts caused mass shortages of.
Rising nationalism and domestic political pressures in China, the US, Japan, and other nations fueled aggressive foreign policies. 
Leaders used external conflicts to divert unrest from rising internal economic and social issues due to a rapidly aging population demographic.

### The Casus Belli for the Conflict between the US and Japan with China
> The casus belli for the US and Japan to start a conflict with China in the 2030s can be traced to a series of provocative incidents and aggressive actions, primarily centered around the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, cyber warfare, and economic sanctions. The failure of diplomatic efforts, coupled with rising nationalism and mutual defense obligations, created a volatile environment where war became seemingly inevitable. The convergence of these factors led to a full-scale military confrontation, reshaping the geopolitical landscape of the region and the world.

Taiwan Strait Incident

One of the most significant flashpoints was the Taiwan Strait, a critical and highly sensitive area for both China and the US-Japan alliance. The situation deteriorated due to China conducting extensive military exercises near Taiwan, including live-fire drills and air incursions into Taiwan’s Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ). These maneuvers were perceived as direct threats to Taiwan's sovereignty and security.
Unfortunately, a collision between a Chinese warship and a US naval vessel patrolling the Taiwan Strait led to significant casualties and damage. The incident sparked outrage and demands for retaliation from both sides, with each accusing the other of deliberate provocation.
The rise of politically-motivated news channels only exacerbated the scale of the accident, with generated media causing more furore amongst the people.

South China Sea Escalation

The South China Sea, with its strategic importance and contested territorial claims, was another major trigger for conflict - China’s continued militarization of artificial islands, including the deployment of advanced nuclear missile systems and aircraft, heightened tensions. 
This was seen as an attempt to dominate critical sea lanes and exert total control over the region. The annexation of Vietnam and Thailand into Greater Communist China led to an uprising and subsequent dissolution of ASEAN.
This split led to China’s imposition of a blockade on commercial vessels passing through the South China Sea, particularly those bound for Japan and Taiwan, and was viewed as an aggressive economic and strategic move. The blockade severely disrupted trade routes and escalated the confrontation.

Cyber Attacks and Economic Warfare

The escalation of cyber warfare and economic aggression contributed to the rising hostilities:

Major Cyber Attack: A devastating cyber attack on Japan’s critical infrastructure, traced back to Chinese state-sponsored hackers, crippled essential services and caused widespread disruption as well as a collapse in the Nikkei. This attack was interpreted as an act of war by Japan and its allies.
    Economic Sanctions and Retaliation: The US and Japan imposed severe economic sanctions on China in response to its aggressive actions. China retaliated with its own set of sanctions, leading to a full-blown economic war that further strained relations and pushed the parties toward military confrontation.
Multiple rounds of diplomatic negotiations and attempts at mediation by international organizations failed to produce a peaceful resolution. The intransigence of both sides and their unwillingness to compromise exacerbated the situation.
    Domestic Political Pressures: Rising nationalism and political pressures within the US and Japan compelled their governments to adopt a hardline stance against China. Leaders used the external threat to bolster domestic support, further escalating the conflict.
Article V of the US-Japan Security Treaty obligates the US to defend Japan in case of an armed attack. As China’s actions increasingly threatened Japan’s security, the US was drawn into the conflict under its treaty obligations.
    Joint Military Exercises: The US and Japan conducted joint military exercises in response to Chinese aggression, demonstrating their readiness to defend against any threats. These exercises were perceived by China as provocative and escalatory, leading to a cycle of retaliation.

#### The Aftermath and New World Order

The economic turmoil in Japan, coupled with broader global financial instability, set the stage for a new world order. 
The bipolar dominance of the US and BRICS became more pronounced with both parties building up nuclear weapon arsenals in preparation for a first strike. 
The 2030s witnessed significant local conflicts driven by economic instability, strategic rivalries, and geopolitical realignments. 

Amid the economic turmoil, a new geopolitical landscape emerged. The United States and China, the two largest economies, solidified their positions as the dominant global powers. 
In this New World Order, the US and China shaped global governance structures, setting the rules for trade, technology, and security. 
Smaller nations navigated a complex web of alliances and dependencies, seeking to balance relations with both superpowers. 
The economic contagion of the 2030s underscored the need for robust multilateral institutions and cooperation to address global challenges, but also highlighted the risks of deep economic interconnectedness and the importance of national resilience.
